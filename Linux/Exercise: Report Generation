Exercise: Report Generation
We are trying to simulate the data generated by a web application which asks user to enter the following

Email address (assume yahoo.com, gmail.com, hotmail.com, rediffmail.com)
City (assume Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkatta)
And phone number (10 digit number)

Write a script to create a subscribers.txt file which has fields: Email address, City, Phone number. 
For each row - Randomly generate email ids with domains from the list mentioned above. Randomly select a city from the list above. Randomly generate a 10 digit phone number.

Subscribers.txt should have atleast 100 data rows.

Now do the following

a) Write a script to select users in subscribers.txt having yahoo.com email address and copy those rows to a new file.

b) Write a script to select users in subscribers.txt who are from Chennai and copy those rows to a new file.
